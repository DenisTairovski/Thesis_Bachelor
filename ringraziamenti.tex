  I want to express my gratitude to all the people that supported me during these years of hard work. 
  A special thanks to Salucci Marco and Benoni Arianna, who followed my work with particular care from the very beginning.\\
 I would like to offer my special thanks to my family, who supported me in every way possible, especially during my hard times.\\
  And last but not least, I am deeply grateful to my best friends, who encouraged me to believe in myself.
